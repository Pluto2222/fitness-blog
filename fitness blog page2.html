                                    <p>Strength training — also known as weight or resistance training — is physical activity designed to improve muscular strength and fitness by exercising a specific muscle or muscle group against external resistance, including free-weights, weight machines, or your own body weight, according to the American Heart Association.right up arrow
                                    <br><br>“The basic principle is to apply a load and overload the muscle so it needs to adapt and get stronger,” explains Neal Pire, CSCS, an ACSM-certified exercise physiologist and account manager at The Gym at Englewood in Englewood, New Jersey.
                                    
                                	<br><br>And what’s important for everyone to know is that strength training is not just about body builders lifting weights in a gym. Regular strength or resistance training is good for people of all ages and fitness levels to help prevent the natural loss of lean muscle mass that comes with aging (the medical term for this loss is sarcopenia). It can also benefit people with chronic health conditions, like obesity, arthritis, or a heart condition.

                             <div class="ani"> 
                               <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">At its heart, strength training is based on functional movements — lifting, pushing, pulling — in order to build muscle and coordination needed for everyday activities, explains Ramona Braganza, 
                                  a Los Angeles-based celebrity personal trainer, certified by the Canadian fitness education organization Canfitpro.
                                  “For some people, the phrase strength training is intimidating, but it’s enhancing your ability to move safely and effectively in your life,” she says. For example: Your ability to lift something and put it on a shelf, 
                                   carry your groceries in the door, bend down and pick something up, or get up after you’ve fallen down. 
                                  “Getting up off the floor requires you to recruit muscles
                                   in your upper body, abs, legs, and glutes,” Braganza says.</p>
                               </div>  
                                  <h2 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Frequency<h2>

                                  <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommend children and adolescents 
                                  ages 6 through 17 incorporate strength training into their daily 60 minutes of physical activity three days per week. Adults should aim to do moderate or intense muscle-strengthening workouts that target all muscle groups two days per week.right up arrow
                                      And you need to rest in between strength training workouts. “You don’t get better during workouts; you get better in between,” says Pire. “You should give yourself a day in between strength training to allow your body to recover and 
                                      rebuild the muscle tissue from the stimulus of lifting or resistance.” This benefit is the obvious one, but it shouldn’t be overlooked. 
                                      “Muscle strength is crucial in making it easier to do the things you need to do on a day-to-day basis,” Pire says — especially as we get older and naturally start to lose muscle.
                                    Strength training is also called resistance training because it involves strengthening and toning your muscles by contracting them against a resisting force. According to the Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine, there are two types of resistance training</p>

                                  <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">If you’re looking to add strength or resistance training to your routine you have a lot of options, Pire notes. You definitely don’t need a gym membership or expensive weight machines, he adds. 
                                  “Squatting on a chair at home, pushups, planks, or other movements that require you to use your own body weight as resistance can be very effective. The more intensity and volume and variety that you can apply to your body the greater the response,” he says. 
                                  Braganza agrees, adding that continuing to challenge yourself by adding free weights or using a weight machine at the gym or altering the tempo you perform the exercises at will help mix things up to create the adaptations your body needs to build strength.

                                  Why The week kicks off with a double header of everyone’s favourite move – the bench press. 
                                  You start with the dumbbell version because you’ll go a bit lighter than with a barbell, and it’s better for warming up your shoulders because you have to work harder to stabilise the joint.
                                  How Lie on a bench with your feet on the floor directly underneath your knees, holding the dumbbells above your chest. Lower them to your chest, then drive your feet hard into the floor and push the dumbbells back strongly to the start position.
                                  Why The incline version of the move puts a slightly different emphasis on your muscles, working the front shoulders a bit more than the flat version does. You’ll probably find you can’t lift quite as much weight because of this.
                                  How Lie on a bench set at a 45° incline, holding a bar over your chest with your hands just wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower the bar until it’s touching your chest, then press it back up.</p>

                                  It’s a really useful, functional exercise so, if your mobility permits it, you’d be wise to make it a cornerstone of your training programme.
                                  How Rest the bar on your back with your feet roughly shoulder-width apart, toes pointing out slightly. Keep your spine in alignment by looking at a spot on the floor about two metres in front of you, then sit back and down as if you were aiming for a chair.
                                  Lower until your hip crease is below your knee. As you drive back up, keep your weight on your heels.</p>

                                  How With your feet shoulder-width apart, hold a bar on your upper chest, hands just wider than shoulder-width apart. Brace your abs, glutes and quads as you press the bar straight upwards. Pause at the top, 
                                  then lower. You may find wrapping your thumbs around the same side as your fingers allows you to lift more weight.</p>

                                  </p><p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">Why Any form of deadlift is an excellent full-body exercise that focuses on the posterior chain (the muscles on the back of your body). We’ve gone for the snatch-grip version 
                                  because the wider grip forces you to reduce the weight and you therefore won’t use up too much energy early in the workout.
                                  The next two moves are quite taxing so you want to keep a bit of energy in the tank.
                                  How Hold a barbell with your hands roughly double shoulder-width apart. Push through your heels and keep your chest up as you drive forwards with your hips to lift the bar.
                                  Why Like the previous move, this develops your glutes and hamstrings, areas that most men would benefit from strengthening. The movement is essentially a hip hinge and has a huge positive carry-over to everyday activity.
                                  How Stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell with an overhand grip just outside your thighs. With a slight bend in your knees, bend forwards from the hips and lower the bar down the front of 
                                  your shins until you feel a good stretch in your hamstrings. 
                                  Push your hips forwards to reverse the move to the start.</p>

                                  Having a strong back will improve your posture, which will allow you to lift heavy weights safely and also reduce your chances of injury.
                                  How Hold the bar with a shoulder-width grip, bending your knees slightly. Bend at the hips until your torso is at roughly a 45° angle to the floor. 
                                  Pull the bar up to touch your sternum and then lower under control. If you’re moving your upper body to shift the bar, the weight’s too heavy.</p>
                                  <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">Whether you’re using free weights, machines or no weights at all, if you want to get the best results from your training you have to match your efforts in the gym in the kitchen. That’s especially the case if you’re looking to get leaner, 
                                  because stripping away body fat to better reveal the muscles beneath requires some dietary discipline.
                                  Mostly, you need to do what everyone should already be doing to stay healthy. Get at least five portions of fruit and veg a day – that’s a bare minimum, and the benefits keep increasing the more portions you eat – and aim for 30g of fibre daily too. 
                                  Opting for wholegrain varieties of carb-rich foods will help you on that front.
                                  Protein is also important, because it’s the fuel your muscles need to repair and rebuild after hard workouts. When you’re working out regularly you should aim to eat 1.4-2g of protein per kilo of bodyweight per day, and consuming around 20g of protein shortly after a training session is a good habit to get into.
                                  You can get all the protein you need from your meals, and you should aim to do so since food contains many other vital nutrients alongside protein, but you can also use supplements to make things easier.</p>

                              <div class ="ani"> 
                               <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">One of the perennial questions about exercise for weight loss is whether to concentrate on aerobic exercise or weight training. In years past, those seeking to lose weight focused on cardio and avoided resistance training. After all, gaining muscle can mean gaining weight.
                                But muscle is lean tissue. Increasing the amount of lean tissue on your body improves your overall body composition and can even provide some metabolic benefits to make weight loss easier.1 Still, that doesn't mean you should avoid cardio. Cardio and weight training are two different types of exercise, 
                                but when you put them together, you have a powerful combination for fat loss success. Weight training burns calories, just like other forms of exercise. You'll usually burn fewer calories during a traditional weight training session than you would during a vigorous cardio session. But there are other ways that resistance training helps you to reach your weight loss goals.
                                Muscle has a slightly higher metabolic rate than fat, so having more muscle helps you to raise your resting metabolic rate (energy expenditure). However, the differences are not dramatic. Even at the high end of predictions (which are disputed), it is just a few calories per day for each pound of muscle increased.3 That helps, but it's not life-changing.
                                But weight training is important to help you maintain muscle—especially if you are dieting. When you lose weight by restricting calories, you are likely to lose some muscle mass.4 Ideally, you want to lose the fat but hold onto the muscle.</p>
                                <h2 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Cardio VS Weights<h2>
                                <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">Both resistance training and cardio workouts (whether steady state or HIIT) can help you to burn more calories each day and reach a caloric deficit to lose body fat. And if you structure your weight training in a circuit style workout
                                to keep your heart rate elevated, both weight training and HIIT workouts may be able to help you to burn more calories, thanks to EPOC.
                                So is it necessary to choose cardio or weight training when your goal is weight loss? Your best bet may be to do both.
                                For some people, combining weight training with cardio into a comprehensive program means doing cardio some days of the week and doing weight training on others. Others prefer to combine both activities into one workout.
                                For instance, you could do 50 minutes of cardio activity on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and then do weight training on Tuesday and Thursday. Or if you have less time to work out, you might do three 25-minute, 
                                high-intensity workouts each week that include vigorous aerobic activity combined with muscle strengthening activities.</p>

                                    She adds that older theories behind losing weight emphasized doing lots of cardio and delaying meals. With this kind of plan, your body's cortisol level—(a stress hormone that regulates your metabolism—skyrockets. But in actuality, this strategy often "backfires and makes people put on weight," she explains.
                                    "With resistance training, you're actually building the muscle tissue, and it's not quite as taxing," says Sims. "So you don't get that cortisol bump." The result? A powerful workout that actually changes your body composition.</p>

                                    So, the less fat you have covering your muscles, the more “toned” and “defined” and “sculpted” you will look. The more fat you have covering your muscles
                                    (or if there’s simply not enough muscle present), the less visible your muscles will be and the less “toned” you will appear.
                                    <br>
                                     <em style="color: black; font-size: 25px;">>Losing more fat.</em>
                                     This is the most common reason why someone isn’t as toned as they’d like to be. Their body fat percentage is too high 
                                     and there’s a layer of fat sitting on top of the muscle they want to see. This makes the person look “soft” and “flabby” rather than lean and toned.
                                     <em style="color: black; font-size: 25px;">>Building more muscle.</em>
                                      Other times, the person will have a low enough body fat percentage, but they’re just lacking a sufficient amount of muscle mass. This makes the person look “thin” and “skinny” rather than lean and toned.
                                     <em style="color: black; font-size: 25px;">> Doing a combination of both.</em>
                                      And in other cases, it’s a little of both. The person is lacking muscle and has too much body fat.
                                      Most people are surprised to hear all of this, because they’re under the impression that getting a toned body is this special thing that happens some special way using special workouts, exercises, methods, and techniques.
                                      But… it’s really not anything like that at all.

                                     <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">When you think about building maximum strength, the first piece of equipment you think of is likely a barbell. That makes a lot of sense — 
                                     barbells allow you to load the most weight and therefore help you overload your body in a very particular way. 
                                     But even though you won’t be hefting the same poundage, working out with kettlebells will still get you plenty strong.
                                     Your time under tension and manipulation of angles and momentum increase while kettlebell training. Additionally, many heavy kettlebell loads will be front-racked, which means your core — and technique — will get hammered with extra tension and challenges throughout your workout.
                                     These factors all combine to mean that kettlebells can help you lift heavier barbells.</p>
                                 <h2 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Workouts that build strength<h2>
                                <div class="ani">  
                                  <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">If kettlebells are the only tool in your fitness box right now, you can perform this workout three or four times a week (providing you’re eating and sleeping enough). Try to rest as little as possible between sets. If you can, 
                                   time yourself when you do need to rest and write it down to track your progress 
                                   from workout to workout and week to week. Perform one set of each exercise: that is your first circuit. 
                                   Perform three to four circuits. Rest between three and four minutes between circuits.
                                   Folks who want to lift heavy weights might want to ease into this workout slowly. Even if you’re pretty strong, it’s important to pace yourself when trying to establish a base of cardiovascular fitness. Get after this workout between one and four times a week, 
                                   depending on your experience with getting your heart rate up over a sustained period.

                                    <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">Begin the goblet squat by holding the kettlebell at chest height with both hands.
                                      Keep your elbows tucked in close to your body and eyes looking forwards.
                                      Feet should be a little wider than shoulder width apart with the toes pointing naturally outwards at 5 – 10 degrees.
                                      Start the squat by pushing your hips backwards as if sitting back into a chair or sitting down with ski boots on.
                                      Ensure your bodyweight is back on your heels and they do not lift off the floor during the complete exercise.
                                      Keep your chest up and facing forwards as if your ribcage is being lifted.
                                      As you sit back and down into the squat weak buttocks and hips may cause the knees to fall inwards, you must force the knees outwards and prevent this from happening.
                                      Continue descending down into the squat until your thighs become parallel with the floor, this is important to achieve maximum activation of the buttock muscles.
                                      Pause at the bottom of the squat position for 1 – 3 seconds and then drive back up to standing by pushing the floor away from you. Stay on your heels.
                                      Once you get to the top position, stand tall, squeeze your buttocks tightly together and avoid leaning backwards.
                                      If you find sitting back into the squat difficult try opening your legs wider to create a little more room for the squat.</p>

                                  <h4 style="color: blue;">(1)Kettlebell push press</h4>
                                  <img src="https://image.boxrox.com/2021/05/kettlebell-shoulder-workouts-e1620403386519.jpg" alt="kpp">

                                    <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">The kettlebell push press is similar to the kettlebell overhead press except that you use your legs a little to help with the press.
                                    The hardest part of the kb strict press is taking the kettlebell from the racked position and moving it the first 12 inches.
                                    You have a distinct mechanical disadvantage with the kettlebell in the racked position so in order to overcome this you can use your legs to pop the kettlebell up.
                                    The kettlebell push press does not involve much work from the legs just a slight knee bend and then a sharp snap of the hips.
                                    Once the kettlebell is moving upwards you can then use the momentum to help with the rest of the overhead press.
                                    The kettlebell push press is not an excuse to not press correctly, but when you can press well it’s a great option to help crank out a few last reps or work into a heavier kettlebell.</p>

                                   <h4 style="color: blue;">(1)Kettlebell lunges</h4>
                                  <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/khlungeflow-1567781199.png" alt="kl">  
                                   <div class="ani"> 
                                    <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">The forward lunge variation is more demanding than the reverse lunge and there is a tendency to ride the lunge forwards so be sure to step and then lunge downwards.
                                    Return back to the standing position by pulling from the rear leg rather than pushing back from the front foot. 
                                    A great introduction to the side lunge with a kettlebell is the cossack lunge variation, great for opening up the hips. Caution should be taken at first to not drop down too deeply as the stretch on the inner thigh can be intense.
                                    So, start steady and increase the depth of the movement as you warm up. The bob and weave is a side lunge variation that is less taxing on the legs and glutes but a little more cardiovascular because the movement can be performed quicker.
                                    Just like the cossack lunge variation the depth of the movement should be increased slowly as the muscles warm up. </p>

                                  <h4 style="color: blue;">(1)Kettlebell rows</h4>
                                  <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1633/7705/articles/kettlebell_rows_1080x.jpg?v=1635739723" alt="kr">  
                                    <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">Stand with your left leg in front, bent, and rest your left arm above your knee. Your back will be lowered towards the floor and supported by the back leg which is stretched behind you and slightly bent. Using your shoulder blade, 
                                    lift the kettlebell towards your chest or rib cage and flex the elbow. Lower it down and repeat.
                                     The kettlebell upright row is powerful, dynamic, and effective. Here are the main body-boosting benefits of weaving it into your regular workout routine:
                                      Muscle strength & growth: Due to its targeted pulling motion, a large group of major upper body muscles are targeted during the kettlebell upright row. As a result, performing this exercise regularly is likely to accelerate your muscle growth and strength in your back, biceps, and shoulders.
                                      Stability & conditioning: The kettlebell upright row activates all major areas of the shoulders, making it excellent for upper body stability and conditioning. By doing frequent upright rows, you will improve your posture while protecting yourself from injury.
                                      Arm power: The upright row is great for the biceps which will make your arms more powerful, improving your performance in other exercises and activities as a result.

                              <section><a href="fitness blog page2.html#post5"><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/chris-hemsworth-bodyweight-workout-1585637148.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.248xh&resize=1200:*" alt="bodyweight"></a>     
                                     <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">"People think that bodyweight training isn't an effective way to get into shape," says Thieme, noting that this isn't true at all. 
                                     "There's always a bodyweight exercise that you can do to challenge your muscles as effectively as a weighted exercise." He recommends doing so through added variations to your traditional bodyweight moves.
                                       If you can easily bang out 30 push-ups in a row, try switching to a variation that challenges you to complete just 10 to 15 reps, like a decline push-up," he says. Check out these push-up variations that take the workout move up a notch. Devin Wiggins, trainer and host of 600 Seconds on Openfit, also suggests slowing down your repetitions, adjusting your angle, and changing other variables 
                                       (like the number of reps or how long you recover for) to make your bodyweight workout even more challenging.
                                     "Nothing in bodyweight training occurs in isolation," says Wegman. Sure, lifting heavy weights really challenges certain muscle groups, but he points out that bodyweight exercises work more of your body at once. "No matter what you are doing in bodyweight training, your core is engaged and activated. Everything should always be engaged and working, so make sure you are thinking of your full body in every exercise." One prime example of this? 
                                     Push-ups, which he says fully work your core even though it's a great arm workout (the same can't be said for bicep curls).</p>

                                <div class="ani">  
                                  <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">The Department of Health and Human Services recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. Aim to include strength training exercises for all major muscle groups into a fitness routine at least two times a week.
                                        To use your body weight in strength training exercises, try exercises such as:</p>
                                     </div>

                                        <li>Situps</li>
                                        <li>Pushups</li>
                                        <li>Pullups</li>
                                        <li>Planks</li>
                                        <li>Step-ups</li> </em>
                                   </ol>    
                                    <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">
                                        Keep movements smooth and controlled. Strengthen the opposing muscles, such as the chest and back muscles, and strive for muscle balance.
                                        Once you can easily do an exercise for one set of 12 to 15 repetitions, try alternative forms of the exercise to give you more resistance or challenge.
                                        For example, you might start out doing a wall pushup, if a classic pushup is difficult. For more of a challenge, try a modified pushup. A modified pushup is similar to a classic pushup, but you keep your knees on the ground during the exercise. 
                                        Once you can comfortably do a modified pushup, try doing a classic pushup.
                                        You can perform many different types of body-weight exercises to work all of the major muscle groups. And you can do body-weight exercises anywhere, using no extra equipment, at no extra cost to you.
                                        But remember to use proper form and technique throughout each body-weight exercise to get the most benefit and avoid injury. Take at least one day off between exercising each specific muscle group to give your muscles time to recover.  </p>

                                   <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">When it comes to fitness, working out doesn’t have to mean going out. You don’t need to trek to the gym to get a good workout. You can accomplish plenty without ever leaving the house. Whether you want to build your endurance, 
                                   increase your strength, burn calories to keep your waistline in check, or do all of the above, you can do it in the comfort of your own home. 
                                   In fact, the benefits of exercising at home are pretty impressive. IT IS CONVENIENT.<br>
                                   Life is hectic, but working out at home makes it easy to fit fitness into your busy lifestyle. There’s no need to waste time and energy gathering your stuff, packing your gym bag, driving across town, and fighting for a parking space. 
                                   All you have to do is don suitable clothes, walk to the designated room, and start sweating.<br> Honestly, if your pajamas can double as workout gear, you can even skip getting dressed!IT IS FLEXIBLE AND VERSATILE.
                                   What’s more flexible than a master yoga practitioner? Your workout routine when you commit to working out at home. Your fitness options won’t be limited by a gym’s operating hours or class schedule. You can exercise whenever you want. In fact, you can even break your workout up and complete it in shifts if that works best for you. Plus, 
                                   thanks to the plethora of internet fitness videos available these days, you can take a fitness class whenever you want.
                                   AVAILABILITY IS NEVER AN ISSUE. If you have ever belonged to a gym, you’ve probably wasted time waiting for equipment or settled for another activity because the class you were eager to take was full. One of the major benefits of exercising at home 
                                   is that you never have to wait for equipment or space, so your workout won’t lose momentum. </p>

                                   <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">People tend to overestimate the amount of calories they burn per workout so it is important to avoid taking in more energy than you expend exercising.

                                    To help you perform better, avoid exercising on an empty stomach. Everyone is different, so you will need to learn:

                                    How long before exercising is best for you to eat
                                    How much food is the right amount for you
                                    CARBOHYDRATES

                                    Carbohydrates are needed to provide energy during exercise. Carbohydrates are stored mostly in the muscles and liver.

                                    Complex carbohydrates are found in foods such as pasta, bagels, whole grain breads, and rice. They provide energy, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. These foods are low in fat.
                                    Simple sugars, such as soft drinks, jams and jellies, and candy provide a lot of calories, but they do not provide vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.
                                    What matters most is the total amount of carbohydrates you eat each day. A little more than half of your calories should come from carbohydrates.
                                    You need to eat carbohydrates before you exercise if you will be exercising for more than 1 hour. You might have a glass of fruit juice, a cup (245 grams) of yogurt, or an English muffin with jelly. 
                                    Limit the amount of fat you consume in the hour before an athletic event.

                                    You also need carbohydrates during exercise if you will be doing more than an hour of intense aerobic exercise. You can satisfy this need by having:

                                    Five to 10 ounces (150 to 300 milliliters) of a sports drink every 15 to 20 minutes
                                    Two to three handfuls of pretzels
                                    One-half to two-thirds cup (40 to 55 grams) of low-fat granola
                                    After exercise, you need to eat carbohydrates to rebuild the stores of energy in your muscles if you are working out heavily.

                                    People who exercise or train for more than 90 minutes should eat or drink more carbohydrates, possibly with protein, 2 hours later. Try a sports bar, trail mix with nuts, or yogurt and granola
                                    For workouts lasting less than 60 minute, water is most often all that is needed.</p>
                                   <h2 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Protien<h2>
                                  <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">Protein is important for muscle growth and to repair body tissues. Protein can also be used by the body for energy, but only after carbohydrate stores have been used up.
                                    But it is also a myth that a high-protein diet will promote muscle growth.

                                    Only strength training and exercise will change muscle.
                                    Athletes, even body builders, need only a little bit of extra protein to support muscle growth. Athletes can easily meet this increased need by eating more total calories (eating more food).
                                    Most Americans already eat almost twice as much protein as they need for muscle development. Too much protein in the diet:

                                    Will be stored as increased body fat
                                    Can increase the chance for dehydration (not enough fluids in the body)
                                    Can lead to loss of calcium
                                    Can put an added burden on the kidneys
                                    Often, people who focus on eating extra protein may not get enough carbohydrates, which are the most important source of energy during exercise.

                                 <p style="color: white; margin: 5px; font-size: 15px;">Water is the most important, yet overlooked, nutrient for athletes. Water and fluids are essential to keep the body hydrated and at the right temperature. 
                                    Your body can lose several liters of sweat in an hour of vigorous exercise.
                                    Clear urine is a good sign that you have fully rehydrated. Some ideas for keeping enough fluids in the body include:

                                    Make sure you drink plenty of fluids with every meal, whether or not you will be exercising.
                                    Drink about 16 ounces (2 cups) or 480 milliliters of water 2 hours before a workout. It is important to start exercising with enough water in your body.
                                    Continue to sip water during and after you exercise, about 1/2 to 1 cup (120 to 240 milliliters) of fluid every 15 to 20 minutes. Water is best for the first hour. Switching to an energy drink after the first hour will help you get enough electrolytes.
                                    Drink even when you no longer feel thirsty.
                                    Pouring water over your head might feel good, but it will not get fluids into your body.
                                    Offer children water often during sports activities. They do not respond to thirst as well as adults.

                                    Teenagers and adults should replace any body weight lost during exercise with an equal amount of fluids. For every pound (450 grams) you lose while exercising, 
                                    you should drink 16 to 24 ounces (480 to 720 milliliters) or 3 cups (720 milliliters) of fluid within the next 6 hours.</p>
